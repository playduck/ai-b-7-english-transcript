\chapter{Conclusion}

% A one- or two-paragraph account of what the take-away of the entire
% presentation experience has been for you. The focus here could be general
% reflection on the whole process – from connecting one’s core purpose to the
% why of the presentation, from team brainstorming, individual research and
% language acquisition to rehearsal, the use of presentation
% techniques/language, and the delivery of prosodic elements. The focus of the
% conclusion can also hone in on any one of these aspects before it extrapolates
% to a more general statement on the take-away experience.

% The conclusion can be seen as a phenomenological reflection on the subjective
% learning experience across all phases and challenges of the presentation
% process and may thus be written in the first person. You may quote material
% from the reader or another source.
